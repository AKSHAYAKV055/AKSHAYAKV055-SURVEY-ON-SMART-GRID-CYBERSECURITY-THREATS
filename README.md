# SURVEY-ON-SMART-GRID-CYBERSECURITY-THREATS
A survey on smart grid cybersecurity threats typically provides an overview of the various risks and vulnerabilities associated with smart grid systems. These systems integrate traditional power grids with advanced information and communication technologies to improve efficiency, reliability, and sustainability. However, this integration also introduces new cybersecurity challenges, such as the risk of cyberattacks targeting the grid's infrastructure, data breaches, malware, and potential threats to the privacy and security of consumer data. The survey usually discusses the nature of these threats, potential impacts, and strategies for mitigation and prevention to ensure the resilience and security of smart grid operations.
